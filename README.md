# OpenWeatherApp

A simple weather app implemented in Angular. It connects to [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) to get and visualize some data.

Login as user name "user" and password "weather".

The app is build with Angular Material and uses [cs.js](https://c3js.org) to visualize a five day weather forecast.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.

To run the app for the first time type "npm install" to get all dependencies.

## Development server

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
